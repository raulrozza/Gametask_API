# GameTask API

GameTask is an open-source gamification app, where users can create their own games, invite players and begin playing.

This API is being currently tested, and you can make requests to it using the URL `https://ufsc-tcc-api.herokuapp.com`.

The app is one component of the whole application. Feel free to also check the [GameTask APP](https://github.com/raulrozza/Gametask_Mobile) and the [GameTask Web](https://github.com/raulrozza/Gametask_Web)
